# Data Structures and Algorithms with Java

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms repository using Java. This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Java, along with explanations, complexities, and examples.

## Introduction

This repository aims to provide comprehensive implementations and explanations of fundamental data structures (like arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.) and algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, etc.) using Java.

## Features

- **Organized Structure:** Categorization of implementations based on data structures and algorithms.
- **Explanation and Examples:** Detailed explanations of each implementation with examples.
- **Java Code:** All implementations are written in Java, making it easier for Java developers to understand and learn.

## Getting Started

To use this repository:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Browse through the folders `DataStructures` and `Algorithms`.
3. Each subfolder contains the specific implementation along with explanations and examples.
4. You can directly use these implementations in your Java projects or study the logic for learning purposes.

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributions are welcome! Here's how you can contribute:

- If you find any bugs or improvements, open an issue or directly submit a pull request.
- Ensure code quality and documentation when submitting changes.
- You can also add new implementations or optimize existing ones.
